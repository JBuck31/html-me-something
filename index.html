                    <h2>Picking Out My Pup</h2>
                    <p class="gray-paragraph">
                        I was never able to have a dog growing up. My dad was allergic, so we couldn't keep <b>any</b> furry friends in the house. As an adult, I found out that I also had an allergy to some dogs. I wasn't willing to abandon my dream of having a four-legged companion, so I began searching online to see what options were available for someone like me. I couldn't bring myself to pay a breeder for a speciality puppy when I knew there were so many great dogs out there just waiting to be adopted. I diligently searched on <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/">Petfinder</a> for wire-haired breeds. I was often disappointed to find that the dog I was interested in had already been adopted. One night, I came across this picture and I just knew he would be the next member of our little family. I made contact with the agency, which turned out to be a one-woman animal control group in a small town outside the Lake of the Ozarks.

                    <h2>Picking Up My Pup</h2>
                    <p class="gray-paragraph">
                        There are times in my life when I have a impulse so strong for change, that I can't do anything but follow it. Sometimes I try out a new hair color. Sometimes I start a new learning journey to change my career. In this instance, I drove 4 hours to a small town I had never heard of to pick up a dog that I barely new anything about. In hindsight, it was actually a terrible idea. I did have the good sense at least to not go alone, and I was able to convince one of my sisters to join me for a spontaneous road trip.

                    <h2>Bonding With My New Buddy</h2>
                    <p class="gray-paragraph">
                        I finally returned home with my new companion around 11:30pm. I was exhausted from all the driving and needed to get up early for work the next day. Even though this energetic ball of fur was my new family member, I was still nervous about letting this stange animal loose in my house while I slept. I tried putting him in a crate to sleep, but I quickly learned that wasn't going to work. I ended up in workout clothes and running shoes and I took my new friend for a 3 mile walk. We had both been in the car a long time and it was good for the both of us to have a chance to stretch our legs. As we walked, I felt my suspiscions confirmed that he would be a good fit for our family. Back at the house, I laid a yoga mat out on the kitchen floor. I was pretty certain he would start to cry again if I put him back in the kennel and we have a strict &quot; no animals in the bed &quot; rule in our house. I knew the only way I was getting any sleep that night was in the kitchen. I grabbed my pillow and a blanket and laid out on the mat. Riley cuddled up next to me and we both were able to finally get a little sleep.
